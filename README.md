> In a silent dojo, shadowed in honor,
A master stepped forward, yet blinded by pride.
Forsaking the code he once vowed to uphold,
Challenging his finest, from envy inside.

> The sensei, corrupted by ego’s desire,
Set out to reclaim glory once held;
Betraying the wisdom he taught with his heart,
Not knowing his fate was already spelled.

> With cunning and tricks he thought he’d prevail,
Yet truth can’t be silenced, nor honor denied;
The student, serene, with wisdom remained,
Defeated his master, who stumbled and cried.

> Years of great teaching undone in a day,
The master disgraced, ashamed of his fall;
The student stood calm, humility strong,
The dojo bore witness to virtue’s call.

> For strength is not measured in trophies or pride,
But ethics and honor and quiet respect;
The sensei’s defeat was not martial or skill,
But loss of his path, integrity wrecked.

> May this tale remind us, let no ego blind,
True mastery’s humble, embracing the way.
The fall of the sensei, a lesson defined:
Integrity lost is a price hard to pay.
